# 3D Model Generator

Generate 3D models from natural language prompts using AI. Describe what you want, and get an STL file ready for 3D printing.

The application uses Google's Gemini API to convert text descriptions into OpenSCAD code, which is then compiled to STL files. You can view, transform, and export your models through an interactive web interface built with Next.js and Three.js.
